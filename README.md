# General info

This repository contains various fixed DSDT (Differentiated System Description Table). DSDT allows your computer sleep, boot and do a lot more cool things.

## How to use
You can edit DSDT file in every plain text capable editor. After you fix issues you need to compile code with IASL.

I recommend using DSDT Editor you can find for example here: http://olarila.com/dsdt/DSDTEditor_Mac.zip
